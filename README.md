# 🧠 Tomasonjo Labs

Welcome to **Tomasonjo Labs** – your experimental playground for the latest and greatest in **LLMs**, **graph-based reasoning**, **GraphRAG**, **autonomous agents**, and everything **Generative AI**.
We build bleeding-edge prototypes, tools, and benchmarks that explore the frontier of what’s possible when you combine language models with structured representations of knowledge.

## 🌐 What We’re About

We’re especially excited about:

- 🤖 **LLM agents** that reason, act, and collaborate
- 🕸️ **Graphs as knowledge interfaces** for LLMs
- 🔎 **GraphRAG** and advanced retrieval strategies
- 📈 **Benchmarking & Evaluation** for agentic systems

If you like systems that go beyond chat and actually think with structure, you’ll feel right at home.

## 🚀 Projects

### 🧾 [legal-tech-chat](https://github.com/tomasonjo-labs/legal-tech-chat)
A GenAI-powered legal assistant that uses **structured extraction**, **graph-based representations**, and **LangGraph agents** to analyze legal contracts.

### 🧪 [text2cypher_llama_agent](https://github.com/tomasonjo-labs/text2cypher_llama_agent)
A benchmark framework for evaluating **text-to-Cypher** agents using **LlamaIndex**. Designed to test how well LLMs can translate natural language into Cypher queries across various schemas and use cases.
